How to Populate the database.
Very simple.

1. Create a database on your dbeaver
2. Name : BusStopDataBase
3. Make sure your dbeaver does not require passwords and the account name is postgres. (For Vincent I not sure but for everyone else it should be that).
4. Once that is done go and start the app by running mvn spring-boot:run on the terminal.
5. Click to open the localhost:8080 open in browser.
6. Now once in browser add /populatebusstops after the localhost:8080 address or you can just copy this link
   ---> http://localhost:8080/populatebusstops
7.  Click enter and a line will come up saying Bus Stops populated successfully!
8.  Check on Dbeaver You should have 5145 records of id, bus_stop_code, description, latitude, logitude.
9. That's all folks.
10. If you are experiencing any issues do ask me. -JOSHUA
